curiosity killed the cat
world is your oyster
you need money to make money
all good things come to those who wait
if at first you dont succeed try try again
never put off till tomorrow what you can do today
dont cross the bridge until you come to it
two heads are better than one
paddle your own canoe
save for a rainy day
life is what we make it
opposite attracts
faint heart never won fair lady
the meek shall inherit the earth
with age comes wisdom
two is company three is a crowd
its better to be safe than sorry
dont look a gift horse in the mouth
do unto others as you would have others do unto you
hitch your wagon to a star
many hands make light work
youre never too old to learn
a word to the wise is sufficient
dont judge a book by its cover
the squeaking wheel gets the grease
a stitch in time saves nine
look before you leap
haste makes waste
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
seek and ye shall find
the best things in life are free
the apple doesnt fall far from the tree
root of the problem
say your piece
screw the pooch
shoot the breeze
sit on the fence
speak of the devil
ace in the hole
lose your marbles
luck of the irish
make a big to do
make a fuss
miss the boat
off the hook
on the ball
out of sight out of mind
out of the picture
out of touch
over the hill
paint a picture
perfect stranger
piece of cake
add insult to injury
all ears
all thumbs
all your eggs in one basket
axe to grind
barking up the wrong tree
basket case
beat around the bush
beck and call
bend over backwards
the best of both worlds
bite off more than one can chew
bite the bullet
a bitter pill
bring home the bacon
burn the midnight oil
call it a day
cant hold a candle
caught between two stools
chew the fat
chickens come home to roost
chip on thier shoulder
cold shoulder
costs an arm and a leg
couch potato
cut a rug
cut corners
cut the cheese
cut the mustard
cut to the chase
a dime a dozen
dodge a bullet
a dogs breakfast
down for the count
high and mighty
hit the road
have a blast
higher than a kite
honest to goodness
hot and bothered
a hot potato
if the shoe fits wear it
in the bag
jog your memory
joke is on you
jump at the chance
jump to conclusion
